# Quizzes in the wild

* This project was built within 44 hours, and thus the code quality wasn't good.

## Things we can do in the future
 - Using `backgrond.js` instead of `content_script.js` at chrome extension
 - Allow users to turn off or turn on our panel
 - Scrape more data or partner with other sites.
 - Host our React application on the cloud instead of loading everything into extension.
 - **Only trigger the action if you select words outside our panel.**
 - Make votes and downvotes work
 - The css might change original pages design, and thus we want to change the way we load it
 - Personalize quizzes by using Machine Learning
 - Auto-tagging by using Machine Learning
 - Add View AS PDF function
