# Quizzes in the wild

* This project was built within 44 hours, and thus the code quality wasn't good.

## Things we can do in the future
 - Using `backgrond.js` instead of `content_script.js`. at chrome extension
 - Allow users to turn off our panels
 - Scrape data or partner with other sites.
 - Host sites instead of loading everything into extension.
 - Only trigger action if you select words outside our panels.
 - The css might change original pages design.
